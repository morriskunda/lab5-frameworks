## Bootstrap Experience
Bootstrap's component-based approach made it easy to create a responsive layout quickly. The grid system was particularly useful for creating columns.

## Tailwind CSS Experience
Tailwind's utility-first approach offered more flexibility in styling. The responsive prefixes (like md:) made it simple to create breakpoints.

## React.js Experience
React's component model and state management made it straightforward to create interactive elements. The declarative approach was cleaner than manual DOM manipulation.

## Completed Features
- Bootstrap navbar, grid layout, button, and alert
- Tailwind responsive card grid with images and buttons
- React component with props and state management
